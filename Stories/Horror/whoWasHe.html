            <h1 class="selected">Who Was He?</h1>
            <p>It was Friday night, as usual I went for my private tuition class at 7pm. The weather was little cold due the afternoon’s rain and the dark clouds still kept the sky covered. I was in hurry &amp; forget to take my umbrella and moreover i felt there won’t be anymore rain. The class went little long that day and it was almost 9 when we came out of the room. </p>
            
            <p>Those dark heavy clouds were making upset sounds and thunderstorms seemed to add more evilness on it. A little drizzling already started.  “Ah! Why didn’t i brought the umbrella?!” Looking at the sky i was trying to guess if it was the night i must get wet. <br>
             Tring…Tring… “Who is calling now?” I came out to the road and received the call. “Hello! Oh aunt swapna! I am sorry i totally forget. But…. No, its gonna rain, coming right now isn’t possible…. Okay..Okay.. i am on my way.” I guess i have short-term memory loss. I was invited to my aunt’s house for dinner and i totally forget that. Her home isn’t far though, 10 minutes from here. I took my bi-cycle &amp; hurried towards her home. I could feel the rain drops were getting heavier.  <br>
            At 9.30 i entered there. Oh! the smell of mutton just kept increasing my hunger. “Anindita, you don’t have to go tonight. Sleep with Anushka tonight.”-aunt said.  <br>
            “Wish i could, but i must complete my class assignment tonight. Can’t stay aunt. Bring the foods, i am so hungry.”  <br>
            “Wash your hands i am giving you the plates.”- aunt headed towards kitchen saying this.  <br>
            Me and my cousin had a little chit-chat and jumped straight on the food. Actually my aunt works as a doctor near Killa, a village in the south. People there are so friendly, they often send foods as gifts.  <br>
            It was the best food i have had in past couple of months. Such yummmy!  <br>
            I didn’t waste time at all, washed my hand and bid them bye.  <br>
            Almost 20 minutes far i had to go. But bad luck, it started raining cats &amp; dogs before even i reach half of the road. <br>
            I waited for couple of minutes under a closed tea stall. “Holy Crap! Load-shading!” The road was absolutely empty, no human i could see near or far. The trees were bending a bit due to the heavy wind &amp; the thunders wanted to touch the road. Sudden lighting of it made the scenario scary. I was little worried. Didn’t wanted to stay there so i kept going without caring about the rain.  <br>
            Almost home and suddenly a large branch of tree feel down almost on me! may be half meter forward. “Thanks God!” <br>
            I was totally shivering. I could see almost nothing, sudden thunderstorm lights were guiding me though. “Who is there?” i could shout but my heartbeat became faster. Saw someone standing under the shade of Raju da’s shop, covered with a big shawl. I didn’t want to see the person again, but i had to cross the road with thousand unanswered questions. At that situation is was scary as hell. I told myself “Okay! 1 minutes &amp; i will cross the road.” I paddled up. Unfortunately my shaky hands could keep the balance with the broken road and i fell down near the shop. “Anindita, go slow…” a sound came up. “Don’t take the Kali bari road, current lines are heavily risky there.” I was little familiar voice took away my nervousness. “Sanjay da is it you! what are you doing here?” I asked surprisingly. I couldn’t see his face properly though. “I am going to the river, to catch fishes.” - He replied. I didn’t expect such wired answer. “Okay. You go home Anindita. Take the Subhas palli road.” I said Okay and reached safely home from there. <br>
            Next morning was more scary for me as i came to know Sanjay da died yesterday afternoon due to electric shock! “Who was it?” i mumbled. Till now i haven’t shared my experience with anyone. Deep inside still there is a fear, fear of some unanswered questions. Who was he? Did someone did joke or is it….? </p>
