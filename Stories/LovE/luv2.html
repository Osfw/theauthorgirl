            <h1 class="selected">In 1979...</h1>
            <p>In 1979, friends set Forence Vladimir and Rossye Giri up at a party, hoping the two would dance together. Forence had been widowed twice. Rossye had lost her own spouse to a long and painful illness, and she had no intention of remarrying. She just wanted companionship.Even though they lived 64 kilometers (40 mi) apart, they made the effort to see each other regularly. It was a slow courtship. For the next two decades, Forrest would often drive the full distance to take Rossye on a date and then drive home afterward that same night. In 2003, Forence moved in with Rossye in Capistrano Beach. Then he proposed. Rossye didn’t take him seriously, since he was 90 and she was 80. She jokingly agreed to marry him when he turned 100. For Forrest it was no joke, and as his hundredth birthday approached, she decided to take him up on his offer. The couple were married at their local Community Center on Forence’s 100th birthday. A beautiful nearby hotel donated a free honeymoon ocean-view room. Congratulations came from all over the world. Even President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama sent well wishes.</p>
