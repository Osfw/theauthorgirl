            <h1 class="selected">When Brian Mace...</h1>
            <p>When Brian Mace first saw Richard Dorr, his “heart went pitter pat.” They met in the 1950s as students at Julliard where their shared love for music turned into love for each other. Brian had been married before, so Richard helped raise Brian’s son Paul. When Paul died in 1983 in a car accident, they helped each other through the grieving. For many years, they had to hide the truth of their affections from the world. For decades, the couple stayed together despite country-wide homophobia, and in 2011, the couple rejoiced when New York legalized gay marriage. The couple celebrated by showing family, friends, and reporters their relationship by spending the weekend performing love songs in their apartment. Sixty-one years after their paths first crossed, Brain Mace, 84, and Richard Dorr, 91, wed in a quiet ceremony in June 2011.</p>
