            <p>Do you believe in soulmates? If you asked me yesterday, I might have said no, but after hearing this incredible story of first loves given a second chance, I think I’ve changed my mind.</p>
            
            <p>High school sweethearts Alan and Jan, and old crushes Gregg and Laura, both graduated from Thomas S. Wooton High School in Maryland between 1977 and 1980. Both pairs lost touch soon after high school, but over thirty years later, they’ve each found their way back to their first love.</p>
            
            <p>Alan and Jan were the first couple to reunite. When they first met, Alan was 12 years old, and saw Jan in one of his acting classes.</p>
            
            <p>“There were lots of boys and girls there, but one in particular was cute as can be with little freckles on her face and cute strawberry blond hair,” Alan told HelloGiggles. “She of course was only 8 or 9 years old and I was too young to even say hi, but I used to think that someday I would marry her.”</p>
            
            <p>Alan’s prediction didn’t lead to anything until the end of his senior year of high school, when he saw Jan in their school’s production of “Brigadoon.” That night, he went cruisin’ to the cast party and saw Jan again. He was taken away by her “Farrah Faucet hair,” even before he realized she was the same girl he remembered from elementary school.</p>
            
            <p>The next week, he took her out on a date to Washington D.C., where Alan says “she wore the cutest little blue dress and [he] fell in love.” Alan and Jan dated the entire summer, sneaking away at every opportunity to be together, and Jan would bring him lunch at the construction site he worked at. He even taught her how to drive in his 1977 orange Ford Mustang.  <br>
                                                                                -Part 2 Will be release Soon</p>
