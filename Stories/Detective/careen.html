     <p>There’s nothing like a stunning twist or shock to keep readers flipping, clicking or swiping pages. Part of the fun for readers is thinking a story is going one way, and getting taken completely by surprise.</p>
     
     <p>Harlan Coben is one of the reigning kings of the art of surprise. “I’ve rarely met a twist I didn’t like,” he has said. His method, if it can be called that, is to write himself “into a lot of corners” and see how things work out.</p>
     
     <p>That’s one way to go. Forcing your writer’s mind to deal with conundrums is a great practice.</p>
     
     <p>But there is another way. Pause after every scene and ask yourself: “What would a reader expect to happen next?” Create a list of at least three directions the story might take.</p>
     
     <p>Then discard those three and do something different. I call this unanticipation.</p>
     
     <p>Another method is the old Raymond Chandler advice: When things slow down, bring in a man with a gun. It doesn’t have to be an actual man with an actual gun, of course. It can be anything that bursts into a scene and shakes things up. Here’s the key: Get your imagination to give you the surprise without justification.</p>
     
     <p>Make a quick list of at least 10 things that just pop into your mind. For example:</p>
     
     <ol>
     <li>A woman runs in screaming.</li>
     <li>The lights go out.</li>
     <li>A car crashes through the wall.</li>
     <li>Heart attack.</li>
     <li>SWAT team outside.</li>
     <li>Marching band outside.</li>
     <li>TV announcer mentions character’s name.</li>
     <li>A baby cries (what baby?).</li>
     <li>Blood drips down the wall.</li>
     <li>Justin Bieber comes in with a gun.</li>
     </ol>
     
     <p>Some things on your list will seem silly. That’s OK. Don’t judge. Look back and find the most original item, and only then find a reason for it. In this case, No. 8 creates the most interest for me. I have no idea where that came from or what it means. But I can make it mean something.</p>
     
     <p>And so can you.</p>
